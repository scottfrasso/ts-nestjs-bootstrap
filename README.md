## Description

Here I used NestJS and added some things to make it a template repository that I can use later.

Thnings that make this different than the vanilla NestJS bootstrap repo:

* Background jobs via CLI
* ~~A database with companies/users/settings with migrations written to support it~~

This repository originally came from [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.
